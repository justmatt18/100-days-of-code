# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 18, 2021
##### (Build my 2019 Vue Project)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed dependency issues from bootstrap vue to node-sass version. Able to run my project. 

**Thoughts:** I felt like I'm not the one who coded the project because it was I can't keep track of all files that I have created. But will look back to that project once I finished my refresher in HTML/CSS and JS. 


### Day 1: January 19, 2021
##### (HTML and CSS Landing Page)
**Today's Progress**: Created a Landing page based on the tutorial using only HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** It's really a good way to have this kind of refesher projects to get back on track ASAP.  Will start our react project this week.
