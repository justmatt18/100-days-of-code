## Log

### R1D1 
Started my refresher by running my 2020 vue project which is a food recipe web app that contains recipes from MEAL DBI API. It felt like I don't know what I put in that project. Need to install npm, yarn, rollback my version of node-sass from 5 to 4.11.1 in order for the project to run. 

PS. Will host my project to netlify or github pages tomorrow.
