## Log

### R1D1 
Started my refresher by running my 2019 vue project which was a food recipe web app that contains recipes from MEAL DBI API. It felt like I don't know what I put and how I was able to come up with that idea. I, then install npm, yarn, rollback my version of node-sass from 5 to 4.11.1 in order for the project to run. I have a lot of refreshers to do starting from a basic html/css course to javascript. 

PS. Will host my project to netlify or github pages tomorrow.
