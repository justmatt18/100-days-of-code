## Log

### R1D1 
Started my refresher by running my 2019 vue project which was a food recipe web app that contains recipes from MEAL DBI API. It felt like I don't know what I put and how I was able to come up with that idea. I, then install npm, yarn, rollback my version of node-sass from 5 to 4.11.1 in order for the project to run. I have a lot of refreshers to do starting from a basic html/css course to javascript. 

PS. Will host my project to netlify or github pages tomorrow. 

### R1D2
Just finished the basic course for creating a landing page. This will be a good start for my css skills. Will start to create our project ASAP.


### R1D3 
Started react 2 crash course videos and will create my own project after understanding this course.

### R1D4
Watched a tutorial on youtube creating a landing page. Added some sections for menu and footer. Need to work more in css cuz' it's giving me a hard time designing :D
